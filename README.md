Here are the deliverables:
* Build out the associations for the models above. If you look at the seeds.rb file, you'll notice that we've put in the desired models and expected associations to make our app work. Every tea can have many bubbles, and every bubble can have many teas. Teas have many bubbles through BubbleTeas.
* For our index page for BubbleTeas, a user should be able to click on a specific BubbleTea and take them to the corresponding show page.
* The BubbleTea show page should have the name, tea, and bubble
* For our index page for Teas, a user should be able to click on a specific Tea and take them to their corresponding show page.
* The Tea show page should have the name, type, color, and all BubbleTeas the Tea is associated with
* For our index page for Bubbles, a user should be able to click on a specific Bubble and take them to their corresponding show page.
* The Bubble show page should have the name, type, color, consistency, and all BubbleTeas the Bubble is associated with
* As a user, I should be able to create, edit, and delete a BubbleTea, and be able to select the Tea and Bubble from a list of those that already exist
* As a user, I should be able to create and delete a Tea and a Bubble
* No BubbleTea can have the same name
* Create an about page and route so we can learn more about your bubble tea shop!
* BONUS: Create a search field on the BubbleTea index page
* BONUS: Create a search field to search by type on the Tea and Bubble pages
